 * API Keys can be used to authenticate the use of [SendGridâ€™s v3 Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html), or the [Mail API Endpoint](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html). API Keys may be assigned certain permissions, or scopes, that limit which API endpoints they are able to access. For a more detailed explanation of how you can use API Key permissios, please visit our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/api_keys.html#-API-Key-Permissions) or [Classroom](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/API/api_key_permissions.html).
